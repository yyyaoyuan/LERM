# CDAN-LERM implemneted in PyTorch

## Prerequisites
- pytorch >= 1.0.1 
- torchvision >= 0.2.1
- numpy = 1.17.2
- pillow = 6.2.0
- python3.6

## Training
The following are the command for each task. The `--method` denote the method to utilize, choosen from ['BNM','LERM','ENT','NO']. The test_interval can be changed, which is the number of iterations between near test. The num_iterations can be changed, which is the total training iteration number.



The codes are heavily borrowed from [CDAN](https://github.com/thuml/CDAN)
